# module2-expressSQL
Tutorial referenced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8uL0lFFoN0&feature=youtu.be

The objective of this project was to build a web application using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize.  Conceptually it was similar to module 1, but this project used some different middleware packages and a different database architecture (ElephantSQL).  This application would store email addresses (not real ones, obviously!) in a database along with users and passwords.  This program also had login functionality in which the user must input credentials (user and password) to access a part of the website.  An administrator user was also implemented, which can access everything on the site.

As this was my second time following a tutorial to learn how to build a web application, this project went a lot more smoothly than module 1.  Any issues that came up were simply singular incorrect characters or a missing right parenthesis after an argument list.  All were easily found and quickly resolved thanks to running the app in 'devstart' mode, which shows the location of any errant code that causes the app to crash.

In reflection, this tutorial reinforced what I learned about Node.js and Express, and also taught me how user authentication, almost ubiquitous in websites today, is implemented.  This can help me when I am to design a website that will include features requiring a user to register to the website in order to access.

On an unrelated note, I found this video tutorial much easier to follow than the online textual tutorial referenced in module 1 because this tutorial was more demonstrative.
